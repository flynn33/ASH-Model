# ASH-Model
The Adinkra-Stabilized Hypercube Model (ASH Model) is a theoretical framework in cosmology and high-energy physics, embedding supersymmetric adinkras within a 9-dimensional hypercube to derive emergent stability and error-correcting properties. Grounded in number theory, SUSY representations, and string-theoretic dimensions.
