# ASH-Model
The Adinkra-Stabilized Hypercube Model (ASH Model) is a theoretical framework in cosmology and high-energy physics, embedding supersymmetric adinkras within a 9-dimensional hypercube to derive emergent stability and error-correcting properties. Grounded in number theory, SUSY representations, and string-theoretic dimensions.

# Adinkra-Stabilized Hypercube Model (ASH Model)

## Overview
The ASH Model is a novel theoretical framework in theoretical physics, proposing a 9-dimensional hypercube scaffold stabilized by supersymmetric (SUSY) adinkra graphs. It integrates mathematical properties of 9 (e.g., refactorability and modular invariance) with SUSY algebras, string theory's critical dimensions, and Many-Worlds branching analogs to derive emergent cosmological properties, such as bell-curve distributions and self-correcting codes. This model addresses gaps in dimensional reductions and error-correcting representations, offering insights for quantum visualization and interdisciplinary unification.

This repository serves as the central hub for our research, including the manuscript draft, verifiable derivations, and simulation code. We are preparing for submission to academic outlets like arXiv (hep-th) and peer-reviewed journals.

## Key Features
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Explicit Garden algebra proofs, SymPy derivations of 9's properties (e.g., τ(9)=3, confirming refactorability).
- **Simulations**: Python code for hypercube transitions and adinkra transforms, demonstrating stability.
- **Reproducibility**: All derivations and outputs are executable; no external dependencies beyond standard libraries.

## Directory Structure
- **docs/**: Manuscript (research-paper.md), appendices (proofs, derivations), BibTeX references.
- **latex/**: main.tex for PDF compilation.
- **src/**: Simulation scripts (e.g., derive_9_properties.py, simulate.py).
